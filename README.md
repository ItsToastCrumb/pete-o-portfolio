# Pete's Porfolio Page

## Description

This is an example portfolio page built for the DU Bootcamp Challenge for Unit 2. The objective was to build a portfolio with a working navigation bar, panels that would link to a project I worked on or created, and contact information for the visitor to reach me.

This page makes use of flexbox in CSS as well as opacity transitions for the project panels. I also used absolute and relative position to inset the project labels into the project panels for a cleaner look. I also prefer moving my "About Me" section to the side of the webpage. This means the navigation links for Work and About will move to the same part of the page but they work as intended by the challenge criteria.
